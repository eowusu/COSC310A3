COSC310A2
=========

This is the repository for assignment 2 in COSC 310. The assignment is to create a simple chat agent.  
We chose to have our agent, codebot, function as a teaching assistant or tutor for first year computer 
science.

FEATURES

Currently, codebot can be greeted by the user and when prompted for a topic will provide a basic 
definition of what the topic is. For example, if asked what variables are codebot will tell the user 
Variables have a type. This type can be a base type, such as int or double, or an object.  Variables
also need to have an identifier such as "number1".

FUTURE WORK

Have codebot be able to support more topics and show how to use certain topics to answer questions such 
as "How do I initialize an int?"
