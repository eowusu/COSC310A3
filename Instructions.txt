variable,~ Declare a variable by stating the type and giving it a variable name. For example, String str; will declare an object called str that can store a String. To initialize a variable, or in other terms assign a value to it, set it equal to what you want it to be, such as str = "This is a string"; . You can declare and initialize a variable in the same line, such as String str = "This is a string";,~

array,~ Declare and initialize an array like so. type[] variableName = new type[size]; For example, to declare an integer array of size 5 (indexed from 0 to 4), you could write int[] array = new int[5]; To store or access values in it, reference the array name and the index. For example, int num = array[3] will assign num the value stored in index 3 of the array. Or array[3]=4; will store 4 in index 3 of the array.,~

byte,~ Declare and initialize a byte like so. byte num = 3;,~

short,~ Declare and initialize a short like so. short num = 4;,~

int, integer, whole number,~ Declare and initialize an integer like so. int num = 4;,~

long,~ Declare and initialize a long like so. long num = 123456789;,~ 

float,~ Declare and initialize a float like so. float num = 12.345f; Note the required 'f' at the end of the number.,~

double,~ Declare and initialize a double like so. double num = 3.14;,~

boolean, true/false, true or false, true, false,~ Declare and initialize a boolean like so. boolean result = true; or boolean result = false;,~

char, character, letter,~ Declare and initialize a char like so. char letter = 'a'; Note the single brackets. chars also have number values, for instance saying char letter = 65; is the same as saying char letter = 'a';, since the number value of 'a' is 65.,~

string, sentence,~ Declare and initialize a String like so. String str = "this is a string". You can also add strings together, and even add chars to strings, using the + operator. Such as String str = "this is a string" + 'a' + "blah blah blah".,~
